<p>BOSTON - May 9, 2016 - Due to necessary construction activity, commuter rail service will be temporarily suspended this weekend between Beverly Depot and North Station in both directions. A temporary weekend schedule for the Newburyport/Rockport Line will be in effect on Saturday, May 14, and Sunday, May 15. The diversion will allow for work on the Beverly Drawbridge and Silver Line project in Chelsea.</p>

These shuttle buses will operate on a "drop off only" basis between Swampscott and North Station. Any inbound passengers at Swampscott, Lynn, or Chelsea must board local MBTA bus service and/or the MBTA Blue Line subway service to Boston. There will be no direct shuttle bus service from Chelsea, Lynn, or Swampscott to North Station.</p>
<p>Passengers seeking outbound Newburyport/Rockport Line service from Boston to Salem Depot or any station thereafter must board a shuttle bus at North Station to Beverly Depot (via Salem Depot) for outbound Commuter Rail connections. Passengers desiring outbound Newburyport/Rockport Line service from North Station to Chelsea, Lynn, or Swampscott Stations must board local MBTA bus service and/or the MBTA Blue Line subway service.
