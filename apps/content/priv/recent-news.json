The contract will be executed with McCourt Construction Company for $16.97 million.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Placed in a primarily residential community, Blue Hill Avenue Station will be constructed as the ninth station for the Fairmount Commuter Rail Line and provide a direct ride to downtown Boston in 20 minutes with no transfers needed. The station will be located approximately six-and-a-half miles from South Station and a quarter mile from Mattapan Square, connecting the community to other neighborhoods along the corridor. The station design includes one center-island platform between Blue Hill Avenue and Cummins Highway located below the street level measuring approximately 768 feet as well as two covered, fully accessible pedestrian ramps from both Cummins Highway and Blue Hill Avenue. The station will also include canopies, warning strips, benches\/windscreens, closed circuit television (CCTV) security cameras, new lighting, new messaging signs, train approach warning systems, and historical graphic panels.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MassDOT Board of Directors and FMCB previously authorized funding for the project on September 2, 2015, in the amount of $26.55 million. The project was advertised in December 2016 with seven bids received. After completion of a bid analysis, the lowest bid of $16.97 million from McCourt Construction Company was chosen.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blue Hill Avenue Station is expected to be open along the Fairmount Line for boarding and disembarking in 2019 after a two-year construction period. On a daily basis, approximately 1,300 customers use the Fairmount Commuter Rail Line. Wachusett Station on the Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line was the last station to open in September 2016 with Boston Landing Station on the Framingham\/Worcester Line scheduled to be open to passengers in April 2017.<\/p>\r\n","format":"full_html","summary":""}],"field_featured_image":[{"target_id":"16","alt":"Commuter Rail Train","title":"","width":"628","height":"421","target_type":"file","target_uuid":"21adb55b-9e49-4b3d-a40f-f94933f56430","url":"http:\/\/mbta.kbox.site\/sites\/default\/files\/2017-01\/Allston%20train.jpg"}],"field_media_contact":[{"value":"MassDOT Press Office"}],"field_media_phone":[{"value":"857-368-8500"}],"field_more_information":[]},{"nid":[{"value":"4"}],"uuid":[{"value":"d27fb4a2-a776-49c0-8cae-57876bc9ace8"}],"vid":[{"value":"125"}],"langcode":[{"value":"en"}],"type":[{"target_id":"news_entry","target_type":"node_type","target_uuid":"1944f2c9-6e14-46d1-9f16-4f54428e8f3c"}],"title":[{"value":"MBTA Urges Customers to \u201cStay Connected\u201d This Winter "}],"uid":[{"target_id":"1","target_type":"user","target_uuid":"4a887460-7f79-4e33-9f24-2cdbbbf7a4c1","url":"\/user\/1"}],"status":[{"value":"1"}],"created":[{"value":"1481039687"}],"changed":[{"value":"1488912845"}],"promote":[{"value":"0"}],"sticky":[{"value":"0"}],"revision_timestamp":[{"value":"1488912845"}],"revision_uid":[{"target_id":"10","target_type":"user","target_uuid":"11008298-0b5b-4491-a92c-97ae40f81a79","url":"\/user\/10"}],"revision_log":[],"revision_translation_affected":[{"value":"1"}],"default_langcode":[{"value":"1"}],"path":[],"body":[{"value":"<p>BOSTON \u2013 The MBTA today launched its Winter Weather public information campaign, urging customers to stay connected during storms and inclement weather.
