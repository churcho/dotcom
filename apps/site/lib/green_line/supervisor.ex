defmodule Site.GreenLine.Supervisor do

  Supervision tree for GreenLine caching.

  It supervises the CacheSupervisor which in turn is responsible for a
  simple_one_for_one set of Agents. Each agent stores data for a
  particular day.

  It also supervises a Cache module which, at application start, spins up an
  agent for every day from today until `Schedules.Repo.end_of_rating`. The
  warmer also schedules itself to run again at 7am ET the next morning. This
  module is also the interface for querying the cache.
