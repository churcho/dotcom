      CharlieCards are durable, plastic cards that may be used to pay fares on Bus and Subway.
      You can load any amount of money for One Way fares and store any pass (1-Day, 7-Day, Monthly) on them.
      CharlieCards are available free of charge at a number of convenient locations.

        <li>Reduced One Way fares</li>
        <li>Ability to reload online and at fare vending machines</li>

      Commuter Rail and Ferry riders can easily purchase any pass (One Way, Round Trip, 10-Ride, or Monthly) through the mTicket app.
      Push “activate” right before boarding and show your mTicket to the conductor upon request.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong>
      This is a very convenient option for smartphone owners and eliminates the risk of misplacing your physical pass.
      Monthly Passes on mTicket are $10.00 cheaper than they are on a CharlieTicket. However, unlike passes loaded onto a CharlieTicket, mTicket passes are not valid for use on the Bus and Subway. Available on the iPhone App Store and Google Play.
