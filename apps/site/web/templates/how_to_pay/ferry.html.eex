      You can purchase a One Way, Round Trip, 10-Ride, or Monthly Pass through the mTicket app. Monthly Passes on mTicket are $10.00 cheaper than they are on a CharlieTicket. However, passes purchased through mTicket app are not valid for use on other modes like they are on a CharlieTicket Monthly Pass. Available on the iPhone App Store and Google Play.
