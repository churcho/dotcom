    <h1>Fares and Passes</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        Your fare is determined by your mode of travel (subway, bus, light rail, commuter rail, or ferry) and the way you pay (Cash, CharlieCard, CharlieTicket, or mobile app).
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>Paying Your Fare</h2>
      <p>
        There are four primary payment methods: CharlieCard, CharlieTicket, mTicket app, and cash on-board. Each mode accepts
        a variety of these methods. Your chosen payment method may affect how much your fare costs, which passes you can purchase,
        and your eligibility to make discounted transfers.

      <h2>Bus and Subway Fares</h2>

        A 1-Day, 7-Day, or Monthly Pass (also called a LinkPass) for Subway will allow you to ride Local Bus for free until the pass
        expires. Payment of Subway One Way fares with a CharlieCard or CharlieTicket will allow you to transfer to Local Bus for free
        within 2 hours of paying your original Subway fare.
