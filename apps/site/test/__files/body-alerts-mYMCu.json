This work will require weekend shutdowns on the entire line from August 5 through October 1. To help passengers travel between Boston and Lowell, the MBTA is running ADA accessible bus shuttles (with WiFi and restroom facilities) that will make stops at every Commuter Rail station.\r\n\r\nLowell bus shuttle tickets are $4 one-way, and monthly passes will be accepted.  Tickets can be purchased on-board, at the North Station Ticket Office, or at the Charlie van outside North Station on the corner of Haverhill and Causeway streets.","created_at":"2017-07-28T11:00:10-04:00","cause":"UNKNOWN_CAUSE","banner":null,"active_period":[{"start":"2017-08-19T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-08-20T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-08-20T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-08-21T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-08-26T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-08-27T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-08-27T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-08-28T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-09-02T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-09-03T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-09-03T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-09-04T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-09-09T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-09-10T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-09-10T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-09-11T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-09-16T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-09-17T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-09-17T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-09-18T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-09-23T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-09-24T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-09-24T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-09-25T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-09-30T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-10-01T02:30:00-04:00"},{"start":"2017-10-01T04:30:00-04:00","end":"2017-10-02T02:30:00-04:00"}]}},{"type":"alert","links":{"self":"/alerts/189855"},"id":"189855","attributes":{"url":null,"updated_at":"2017-06-23T06:14:51-04:00","timeframe":"ongoing","short_header":"Main St @ Kendall Sta - Red Ln - moving permanently to the area east of the crosswalk, where buses currently layover, beginning Mon, Jun 26","severity":3,"service_effect":"Main St @ Kendall Station - Red Line (inbound) and Main St @ Kendall Station - Red Line (inbound) moved","lifecycle":"ONGOING","informed_entity":[{"stop":"2231","route_type":3,"route":"64"},{"stop":"place-knncl","route_type":3,"route":"64"},{"stop":"2231","route_type":3,"route":"68"},{"stop":"place-knncl","route_type":3,"route":"68"},{"stop":"2231","route_type":3,"route":"747"},{"stop":"place-knncl","route_type":3,"route":"747"},{"stop":"2231","route_type":3,"route":"85"},{"stop":"place-knncl","route_type":3,"route":"85"}],"header":"Main St @ Kendall Station - Red Line - moving permanently to the area east of the crosswalk, where buses currently layover, beginning Monday, June 26.","effect":"STOP_MOVED","description":"Affected routes:\r\nCT2\r\n64\r\n68\r\n85","created_at":"2017-06-23T06:14:51-04:00","cause":"UNKNOWN_CAUSE","banner":null,"active_period":[{"start":"2017-06-26T04:30:00-04:00","end":null}]}},{"type":"alert","links":{"self":"/alerts/198024"},"id":"198024","attributes":{"url":null,"updated_at":"2017-08-17T14:49:36-04:00","timeframe":null,"short_header":"Route 86 experiencing minor delays due to traffic","severity":3,"service_effect":"Minor Route 86 delay","lifecycle":"NEW","informed_entity":[{"route_type":3,"route":"86"}],"header":"Route 86 experiencing minor delays due to traffic","effect":"DELAY","description":null,"created_at":"2017-08-17T14:49:36-04:00","cause":"TRAFFIC","banner":null,"active_period":[{"start":"2017-08-17T14:49:30-04:00","end":"2017-08-17T18:51:29-04:00"}]}},{"type":"alert","links":{"self":"/alerts/105025"},"id":"105025","attributes":{"url":null,"updated_at":"2017-08-07T08:09:43-04:00","timeframe":"ongoing","short_header":"Elev. 941 N Station - Lobby to the Commuter Rail & Boston Garden will remain closed until further notice due to construction of the Boston G","severity":3,"service_effect":"elevator unavailable","lifecycle":"ONGOING","informed_entity":[{"stop":"70026","facility":"941"},{"stop":"place-north","facility":"941"},{"stop":"70027","facility":"941"},{"stop":"70205","facility":"941"},{"stop":"70206","facility":"941"}],"header":"Elevator 941 NORTH STATION - Lobby to the Commuter Rail and Boston Garden will remain closed until further notice due to construction of the Boston Garden Development.","effect":"ACCESS_ISSUE","description":"If exiting, return to the fare lobby to use North Station Elevator 912 (lobby to Causeway Street) or pass through the fare gates, walk the full length of the Green Line platform to use North Station Elevator 909 (lobby to Valenti Way).
