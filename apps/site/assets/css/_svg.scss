//
// SVG CLASSES
//
// This file should ONLY be used to manipulate fills and strokes for SVG icons
// that have been added using &SiteWeb.ViewHelpers.svg/1. All rules in this file
// should be namespaced under the ".c-svg__#{ICON-NAME}" class added by that
// function; inside of those namespaces, you may target elements and breakpoints
// as needed. Do not use classes or IDs as selectors inside of these namespaces.
//
// Be aware that these nested selectors have a higher specificity than our normal
// selectors, which is why it's very important to limit these rules to only
// fills and strokes. Any other styling for these SVGs (positioning, width,
// height, etc.) should be handled elsewhere.

[class*=c-svg__icon] {
  // setting this broadly enables the height and width of each SVG to be defined by the
  // height/width of the containing span, instead of having to target the svgs themselves.
  display: inline-block;

  svg {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
  }
