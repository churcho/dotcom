# Brunch namspaced build - Dotcom Chrome
This build creates header and footer HTML templates and minified CSS that we share with contractors. All CSS classes are prefixed with "mbta-" and the included bootstrap shim for toggling (vendor/collapse.js) only works with this prefix.

The compiled version is manually uploaded to a shared access repository.
See https://github.com/mbta/dotcomchrome for more information
