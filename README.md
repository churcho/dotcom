# DotCom

The new face of http://mbta.com/

## Getting Started

1. Install Erlang/Elixir: http://elixir-lang.org/install.html
1. Install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
1. Install Sass: `gem install sass`
  * You might get a permission error here.  You can either `sudo gem install sass`, or install a Ruby environment manager.
1. Install Phoenix: http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation
1. Install our Elixir dependencies: `mix deps.get`
1. Install our Node dependencies: `cd apps/site && npm install`

## Running the Server

    mix phoenix.server

Then, visit the site at http://localhost:4001/

## Running the tests

Run `mix phoenix.server` to start a server in one window, then open a separate window and run `npm test` from the main folder. This will execute the following scripts in succession:
* `mix test` -- Phoenix tests
* `npm run js:test`  -- JS tests
* `npm run backstop:test` -- Backstop tests (see section below for details)

Note that all tests will run even if one of them fails, and there is no final summary at the end, so pay attention to the output while they're running to make sure everything passes.

Other helpful test scripts (all run from the main folder):
* `npm run backstop:reference` -- create new backstop reference images
* `npm run backstop:bless` -- allow backstop tests to run after changing the backstop.json file without creating new reference images
* `npm run backtop:test` -- run only the backtop tests
* `npm run test:js` -- run only the js tests
* `mix test` -- run only the Phoenix tests

## Updating Backstop Tests

We use [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) to test for unexpected visual changes. Backstop works by keeping a repository of reference images; when you run a backstop test it takes snapshots of the pages on your localhost and compares them to those references images; if anything has changed then the test will fail. This helps us catch unintended changes to the UI (typically a CSS selector that is broader than expected). Whenever you make a change that affects the UI, you will need to update the backstop images. 

Basic steps:
1. Run `mix phoenix.server` to start your server
2. In a new terminal window, run `npm run backstop:test` -- this will do two things:
    * Runs a backstop test, which should fail
    * Generates a new folder in `apps/site/backstop_data/bitmaps_test/` with images for each test that were generated from your localhost
3. Review the test output and confirm that the only tests that failed were the ones with changes you meant to make (if not, fix any unintentional changes before proceeding)
4. For each image that failed as expected, delete the corresponding image in `apps/site/backstop_data/bitmaps_reference` and replace it with the new image generated by the test.
6. Run `npm run backstop:test` to make sure that all tests now pass.

## Building

1. (once) Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
1. Build the .ZIP package: `sh build.sh`

This will build the release in a Docker container, and put the files in `site-build.zip`

## Deploying

1. (once) Install the AWS EB CLI: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html
1. (once) Get AWS credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)
1. (once) Create `~/.aws/config` with the following:

    ```
    [profile eb-cli]
    aws_access_key_id = <YOUR ACCESS KEY ID>
    aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR SECRET ACCESS KEY>
    ```

1. Deploy the built file with `eb deploy`

You should now be able to see the new site at http://mbta-dotcom-dev-green.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
